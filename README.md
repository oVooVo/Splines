# Splines

This tiny program allows you to create, display and edit splines with an arbitrary number of points.

You can choose between linear, Bézier and b-spline interpolation. In case of Bézier interpolation, you can manipulate the tangents.

There are some major issues:
- You cannot control the number of interpolation points
- major interpolation algorithms missing
- you can only draw splines, no higher level objects such as circles or rectangles, etc.
- not user friendly
- and several minor things.
